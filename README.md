somapy
======

A command line application for streaming soma.fm stations, written in Python, and
licensed under the GNU GPLv3. See LICENSE.txt for more information.

Currently, the program simply lists the soma.fm stations and asks which the user
would like to play. A fairly simple interface. Eventually, I would like to use
a curses interface, or possibly urwid, for a more attractive UI and interactvity.
